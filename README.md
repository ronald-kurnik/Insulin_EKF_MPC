# Simplified Glucose-Insulin Model (Nonlinear)
This is a highly simplified, hypothetical model for demonstration.
It's a two-state model: [glucose (mg/dL), insulin_in_plasma (mU/L)]
Glucose dynamics are influenced by insulin and a constant production rate.
Insulin dynamics are influenced by insulin delivery and clearance.
